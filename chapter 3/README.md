This folder contains the scripts use to run the multievent capture-recapture model of chapter 3 entitled: Once a floater, always a floater?
Survival and breeding probability in relation to reproductive status in the spotless starling (*Sturnus unicolor*). There are two scripts: 

- script_chapter3 contains the model and the functions that are used to examine the result of the model. 
- script_ppc_chapter3 contains the code used to conduct the posterior predictive checks of the model. Note that this script is originally divided in three parts due to the requirement of high amounts of memory. In this script, the three parts are shown together for the sake of simplicity. 

Both scripts were run originally in a supercomputer (Finisterrae III - CESGA). 

Data for running this script is openly available upon publication.
