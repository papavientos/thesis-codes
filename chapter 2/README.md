## chapter 2

Folder containing the scripts used for the analysis of chapter 2: Not all those who wander are lost: insights on the prospecting behaviour and future settlement of floaters in the spotless starling (*Sturnus unicolor*)

- ```script_DISTANCES_chapter2.R´´´: in this script is shown how Fig 1 in chapter 2 is generated. In this script we compare the distribution of the bootstrapped distances between the centroid of the prospecting area and the final nest to the distribution of bootstrapped distance between the centroid and a random nest in the field area.
- ```script_GLMM_chapter2.R´´´: this script contains the code for the GLMM models that explore a relationship between the characteristics of the prospected nest boxes and the final chosen nest.
- ```script_MCP_chapter2.R´´´: here it is shown how minimum convex polygons (MCP) were calculated for each focal individual.
- ```script_SPATIAL_chapter2.R´´´: script that shows the calculation of the spatial autocorrelation using the mean reproductive success of nest boxes of 10 years of monitoring.
-  ```script_TEMPORAL_chapter2.R´´´: script that shows the calculation of the temporal autocorrelation of reproductive success within each nest box.
