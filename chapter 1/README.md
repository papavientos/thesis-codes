# chapter 1
Folder containing the script used for the analysis of chapter 1: *Sexual differences in phenotypical predictors of floating status: body condition influences male but not female reproductive status in a wild passerine*

In this script, sections are organized following this order: 

- Female adults
- Female nestlings
- Male adults
- Male nestlings
- Female path analysis
- Male path analysis

Within each section, the corresponding dataset (available at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_rar/19705033) is loaded. For each different group, the used workflow is the same. At the end of each section, the environment is cleaned.
